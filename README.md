#  Intelligent Document Classification & Summarization System

##  Overview
The **Intelligent Document Classification & Summarization System** is an **AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP) application** designed to automatically **classify documents into predefined categories** and generate **concise, meaningful summaries** from large textual content.

This system helps in managing large volumes of documents by transforming unstructured text into **organized, digestible, and actionable information**.

---

##  Problem Statement
Organizations and individuals often deal with massive collections of documents such as:
- Reports
- Articles
- Academic papers
- Legal and business documents

Manual classification and summarization are:
- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Not scalable

Traditional keyword-based approaches fail to understand **context, semantics, and intent** within documents.

---

##  Proposed Solution
This project introduces an **intelligent NLP-based system** that combines **machine learning and text summarization techniques** to automatically analyze documents.

The system:
- Understands document content
- Assigns appropriate categories
- Generates summaries that preserve key information
- Reduces human effort in document analysis
